NOTE: All "I/O Pin Number" designations are as listed in the file "Custom_64_pin_Padframe.jpg" 
        available in the "Project_Final_Report" assignment in the ELEC 422 (Spring 2024) Canvas page.
      For instance, I/O pin 1 is located in the Magic subcell titled "PadBiDir 17_21". Furthermore,
        I/O pin 2 is located in the Magic subcell titled "PadBiDir 17_20" , and so on.
NOTE: "Direction" values are of the format "input/output {bit number or index assignment}". 
       All signals with "direction" values lacking an explicit specification for the amount of 
        bits are assumed to be 1-bit signals.
NOTE: A signal with the value "none" for its "Signal Name" refers to an empty I/O pin.
