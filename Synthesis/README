README for Synthesis

Synthesis is done using Synopsys Design Compiler (DC).

A .tcl script has been created called "run" which runs Design Compiler in a batch mode.

The input Verilog files are listed in the compile_dc.tcl file.
You will need to update this for your designs, see the comments in the compile_dc.tcl file. 

The output will be a structural Verilog file with the cells filled from our cell library.
The output Verilog file will have a .vh file extension.

You will then need to copy the .vh file to the Questa_post_DC folder for further simulation.
